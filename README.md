# Bonafide Students Face Detection System

## Overview

The Bonafide Students Face Detection System is a machine learning project developed to enhance student authentication and entry tracking in educational institutions. It was collaboratively designed and developed by a team of three, with the primary goal of preventing non-bonafide students from gaining unauthorized access. This project replaces the traditional manual entry process with an efficient and automated solution.

## Project Duration

- **Development Period:** January 2023 to June 2023

## Key Features

- **Face Detection:** Utilizes machine learning algorithms for robust face detection.
- **Authentication:** Verifies the identity of students to ensure bonafide access.
- **Automation:** Replaces manual entry processes, reducing time and improving efficiency.
- **Team Collaboration:** Developed collaboratively by a team of three members.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The primary programming language used for this project.
- **Machine Learning:** Leveraged machine learning algorithms for face detection and authentication.
